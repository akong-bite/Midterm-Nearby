            <strong>The Nearby</strong> is a concept of relational richness, formed through
            daily interactions, the juxtaposition of differences, and historical layering, 
            rather than fixed boundaries or static communities.

          <strong>The Disappearance of Physical "Nearby":</strong><br>From Space to Network
         </a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            "Nearby" refers to a network of relationships based on geography, familiarity, 
            and everyday interactions. It is an interdependent social support system that 
            relies on face-to-face interactions and trust.
        </p>
        <p>
            Physical "nearby" is not merely a measure of geographic distance but represents 
            social connections and interactions formed through adjacent spaces and familiar 
            communities (e.g., greetings at the market, neighborly exchanges).
